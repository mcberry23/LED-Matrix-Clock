<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The screen on my iHome clock was fading over time.  I was afraid that eventually lose all visibility of the screen.  Instead of buying a new clock I decided to build my own for the fun of it.  This clock composed of the Adafruit 32x16 LED Matrix controlled by the Parallax Propeller microcontroller.  The result was pretty cool.  I built a nice wooden enclosure and mounted some lit push buttons on top.  I currently use it as my main clock for my room.  Eventually some future functionality that I will possibly add is serial communication between the raspberry pi and propeller in order to get the weather.  I also hope to add alarm functionality to utilize the speaker I have built in to it.</p>
